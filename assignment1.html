  Assignment #1 - REMEMBER TO FOLLOW THE STYLE GUIDE

  1. Fork your own version of this repo

  3. Basing your code off of the below example, tell me a little bit about yourself

    <!--
      In this section (<body>), create a h1 tag stating your name
      Beneath that, create an unordered list with at least 3 list items
      that describe your web development experience (if any, it's ok if this is all new :D)

      This is just a quick exercise to show that you know how to work with git and GitHub
      No styling or scripting is required for this assignment

      If you don't know how to make the above mentioned tags, either take a look around on
      the internet, or don't hesitate to ask me!

    <ul>
      <li>When I was thirteen, I used static HTML to create a basic webcomic site. I only ever uploaded two strips...</li>
      <li>During my co-op rotations, I primarily identified other people's bugs in the backend and sometimes had the chance to introduce my own using C#. (The website's backend was built on ASP.net, Microsoft SQL, and C#) </li>
      <li>Though less frequently, I also identified and introduced bugs in the frontend using Javascript. I even had the pleasure of combing through Silverlight code on more than one occassion. (The frontend of the application was written to be compatible back to IE7, if memory serves.)</li>
